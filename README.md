# EmojiFonts

Python scripts to backport Apple Color Emoji font.

# How to use

1. Copy `Apple Color Emoji.ttc` from `/System/Library/Fonts` of your macOS instance to the root of this repository and rename it to `AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttc`.
2. Execute `get-fonts.sh`
3. Once finished, you will get `AppleColorEmoji@2x-out.ttc` that's compatible with iOS 13 and below and `AppleColorEmoji@2x.ttf` that's compatible with iOS 9 and below.

# How it works

Will fill this in once I don't have selective participation.
