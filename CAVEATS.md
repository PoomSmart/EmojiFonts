# Caveats

Missing emojis or limitations of each non-Apple themed font will be listed here.

## Blobmoji Emoji

- Nothing of significant.

## Facebook Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.

## FluentUI Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.
- Upstream is missing family, couple, flag, skinned handshake, paperclip, technologist and some other emojis.

## Google Noto Color Emoji

- Nothing of significant.

## JoyPixels Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.

## OpenMoji Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.
- Couple emojis of different skins will not share the same hair color as it seems so in the original OpenMoji. In my opinion, this is better because why would two people of different races always share the same hair color?

## Samsung One UI Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.
- One UI 6 beta still has version 5 of paired emojis.
- Eye in speech emoji is from the older design of One UI. Samsung just didn't include it in One UI 5.0 officially.

## Toss Face Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only. For emojis that are not supported, they are replaced with Twemoji Unicode 15.0 because this vendor has the closest emoji style.
- _PNGs only_.

## Twitter Twemoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.

## WhatsApp Emoji

- Unicode 15.0 only.

## Notes

_PNGs only_: They come in PNGs which means adding silhouettes, handshake and couple emojis are difficult. If they were in SVGs, we can simply write a script to remove parts that we do not need.
