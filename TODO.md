# TODOs

- [ ] Convert from SVGs into PNGs with sufficient memory (to replace the slow `inkscape`)
- [ ] FluentUI Emoji HD
- [ ] Facebook Emoji HD (if they ever support it)
- [ ] Group files by theme?
- [ ] Rely more on GSUB/MORX tables of the font than manual name mapping
- [ ] Streamline code for manipulating SVGs for couple emojis
- [ ] Un-uglify SVGs manipulation code
- [ ] Code that do not offend linting too much
